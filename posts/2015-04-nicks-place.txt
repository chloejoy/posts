You know the folks you see on HouseHunters who insist they need a huge open space to entertain all their many friends? And you (the person binging on HouseHunters and oreos alone on the couch) can’t help but think, Who ARE these people with so many “FRIENDS” and so many “PARTIES”? If I didn’t know better, I’d think they were making it all up to look cool on national television. But I do know better, because I know Nick. He’s our friend who enlisted me to decorate his place in DC, and I’m convinced he has a close personal friend in the city for every single person I interact with in a three-month period, including cashiers, bus drivers and security guards. He’s just a magnetic, likable, interesting guy. Nick throws dinner parties and happy hours like nobody’s business, and he was starting to get a little self conscious about being a real-life adult living in a manchild bachelor pad. He wants his home to not only feel more grown-up and settled in, but also to serve as a welcoming and comfortable space for entertaining.

His place is dripping in potential, so when he asked for my help I couldn’t say yes fast enough. It’s HUGE by city standards, with an open floor plan, gobs (I mean GOBS) of natural light, and a landlord who is game to make some improvements. That’s right – landlord, or LL for short. This is a rental, which means the sky is not the limit, but I’m excited to see what’s possible without going overboard. The LL has agreed to replace the broken window blinds with some roman shades I picked out, paint the walls (that are in serious need of repair) a color he agrees to, and even make some big – albeit low-cost – improvements in the kitchen (the top cabinets are falling off the walls). I’m not sure how Nick got him to agree to all that – I should ask him to share his secrets sometime – but I’m pretty stoked about it. My guess is it has something to do with Nick and his roommate being dream tenants for the last 5 years and his not planning on leaving anytime soon. 

That said, most of Nick’s own money in the space should go toward things he can take with him. He has most of the big pieces already – a sectional sofa he purchased last year, a dining table, a buffet, and a TV. Everything else is fair game.

The first order of business is a new rug. His current 4 x 6 shag was a quick buy on Amazon and it’s about a third of the size this room calls for. We’re upgrading to a 9 x 12, which is big enough for each end of the sectional to comfortably rest on. A rug that big would usually cost an arm and a leg and maybe your firstborn, too, but RugsUSA runs 75% off deals often enough to make me a devotee. Since we’re going safe on the wall color (remember LL is making the final call), and given that the sofa is a huge swath of gray, I’m using the rug to bring in some color and personality. The blue and off-white moroccan shag do just that, while hinting that the guy standing on it is well-traveled (he is). I’ll carry the blues around the room with decorative accents, like vases, pillows and artwork, and inject some life with vibrant plants. 

Second order of bidness: seating. Nick needs the kind that’s always available (like a new cute accent chair), as well as the kind that can be stashed out of the way during business hours. I’m a fan of the Oswald tufted slipper chair from West Elm – it’s low-profile, reasonably comfortable and the frame is a really fun and unexpected. For stashable seating, I like the Terje folding chairs from Ikea. They’re wooden, so they feel sturdier than plastic and classier than metal, and they’re more comfortable than a backless stool. Speaking of back support – something that probably never occurred to you until you turned 28 – the Terje’s has a convenient hole for hanging. So, rather than take up precious closet space I’m installing hooks on the wall by the juliet balcony to keep the chairs out of the way but still within arm’s reach.

The new coffee table will follow the same ethos – there when you need it, gone when you don’t. Nick loves having the ottoman in front of the couch for vegging out – who wouldn’t?! –  but he could really use some more surfaces for guests to set down drinks and plates when they’re mingling. We’re going to bring in side tables, trays and an occasional coffee table … probably one similar to my own where the top lifts up and the legs fold away so it doesn’t have to be front and center all the time. Special bonus: the top can also rest on the ottoman like a big tray for movie snacks when he’s just hanging out. 

Next up: lighting. This apartment has more windows than I thought possible on a row house. It’s amazing during the day – the light streams in from all directions – but it’s seriously lacking at night, and no dinner party (or room, for that matter) should be without mood lighting! We’re going to bring in some funky sconces, table lamps, and a big pendant over the dining table (all plug-n-play, no hardwiring) to make the space equally inviting at night. 

I mentioned the dining table, which is actually used as the desk when there are no dinner parties going on. It’s one of the first things you see when you come up the stairs, so I’d like to move the computer and paperwork to its own designated spot tucked in the corner where the Billy bookcase lives now. I’m thinking one of these ladder desks from CB2 or a glammed-up closet system like ___ did here ** will do the trick, because we still need shelving for all those important, leather-bound books. 

What doesn’t fit on the new shelves will go inside the existing credenza right next to the printer that’s already hiding in there quite sneakily. I want to swap that lamp for something with more pizzazz, and use the tabletop as a drink station for parties.

The last big item I want to replace is the TV stand. It’s tough to make a TV look nice, but I think a sharper, brighter media stand with some closed storage can certainly help. The current, black stand blends in with the TV, and together they make an even bigger eye sore. Plus, the stand is only a couple inches wider than the TV itself, so stuff is falling off the sides. I say we get something that fills up that space better while still being low-profile and bright. I’m really drawn to this Stockholm media stand from Ikea. In case you’re wondering how practical it is to put your cable box behind a door, allow me to introduce you to the narrow band antenna. You can hide your cable box and eat it too! (uhhh)… what I mean is, you don’t have to be able to point the remote or even see the cable box to be able to control it with an antenna like this.

Last but not least, the TV stand.
